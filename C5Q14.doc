Refactoring is a way of restructuring your code so that it looks cleaner, but operates the same. One article claimed that the term refactoring was
derived from mathmatics. I think this makes sense as it is mimicking the function of factoring in mathmatics. You basically take the code
that you already have and restructure it internally without harming the external structure. The goal is to have cleaner or simpler source code.
